 # Stoke Glow Lightbar
This PCB is designed to work with the Stoke Glow series of PCB's

Features:
 - 25 x SK6812RGBW LED's

Follow [this guide](https://theboardgarage.com/articles/vesc-one-wheel-lights-arduino) from Mario Contino on how to use the headlights and wire them. The PCB has a Silkscreen layer showing how all the pins are wired, however it is still recommended to cross reference with the gerber files
